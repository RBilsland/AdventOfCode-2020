My daily solutions to the festive tradition that is [*Advent of Code, 2020* (https://adventofcode.com/2020/)](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). 

I'm a C# developer so all these have been build as .NET Core 3.1 console applications concentrating on result rather than looking aesthetically pleasing.

Enjoy the challenge of being presented with requirements, designing a solution, coding, debuging and then delivering a result within a timeframe. Who said being a developer was just code, code and more code!
